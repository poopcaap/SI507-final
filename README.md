To begin this program, you can download search.py and the json directory. command 'python search.py' to start the program.

The program will show:

Select option (1: Route Search, 2: Airline Code Search, 3: Airport Code Search, 4: Exit):

The first function is the main function of the program. It search the airline code, departure code, the plane model and distance range. And it will output all the route that fit the result.
